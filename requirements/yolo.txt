# Pin FastAPI and Pydantic for v1 compatibility
fastapi<=0.100.0,>=0.95.0 # Or a specific version like 0.99.1
pydantic<2.0.0,>=1.10.0    # Or a specific version like 1.10.13

# Core ML/CV for YOLOv8
torch # Keep this, deploy.yml for mmpose installs a specific CUDA version, yolo env can get a compatible one
torchvision # Companion to torch
ultralytics # For YOLOv8 models

# Other necessary packages
opencv-python # For image/video processing (consider opencv-python-headless if no GUI needed)
supervision # For annotations, if used by yolov8_service.py
uvicorn[standard] # ASGI server (uvicorn is already listed with [standard] in your original requirements.txt)
httpx # If yolov8_service.py makes outbound HTTP calls
python-multipart # For FastAPI file uploads
google-cloud-storage # If yolov8_service.py interacts with GCS

# Make sure numpy is also present if not pulled in as a sub-dependency, often needed.
