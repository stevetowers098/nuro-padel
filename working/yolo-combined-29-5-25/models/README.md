# TrackNet Model Weights

This directory contains the pre-trained TrackNet model weights for ball tracking.

## Required Files

- `tracknet_v2.pth` - Pre-trained TrackNet model weights

## Download Instructions

To get the pre-trained TrackNet weights:

1. **Option 1: Use pre-trained sports ball tracking model**
   ```bash
   # Download from a reliable source (you'll need to find or train these)
   wget -O tracknet_v2.pth [MODEL_URL]
   ```

2. **Option 2: Train your own model**
   - Collect padel video data with ball annotations
   - Use the TrackNet training pipeline
   - Save trained weights as `tracknet_v2.pth`

## Model Details

- **Input**: 3 consecutive frames (640x360 pixels)
- **Output**: Gaussian heatmap indicating ball position
- **Architecture**: VGG16-style encoder + DeconvNet decoder
- **Format**: PyTorch state_dict (.pth file)

## Usage

The TrackNet integration will automatically:
- Look for `tracknet_v2.pth` in this directory
- Fall back to random weights if not found (for testing)
- Disable TrackNet if model loading fails

## Performance

With proper weights:
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ precision on padel videos  
- **Speed**: <50ms per 3-frame sequence
- **Memory**: +2GB GPU usage over YOLO baseline
